# Update

Please check out our most recent work [SMTSampler](https://github.com/RafaelTupynamba/SMTSampler).
SMTSampler brings some important improvements over QuickSampler and also allows sampling from SMT formulas with bit-vectors and arrays.

# Building

Install dependencies

```
sudo apt install git g++ make python-minimal
```

Clone repos

```
git clone https://github.com/RafaelTupynamba/quicksampler.git
git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git
```

Build z3 (with a patch to check samples generated by QuickSampler)

```
cd z3
git am -3 ../quicksampler/check/0001-Check-validity-of-samples-generated-by-QuickSampler.patch
python scripts/mk_make.py
cd build
make
sudo make install
cd ../..
```

Build QuickSampler

```
cd quicksampler
make
```

# Running

Simply run with

```
./quicksampler -n 10000000 -t 7200.0 formula.cnf
```

QuickSampler will create a file `formula.cnf.samples` with the samples generated and print statistics to standard output. The file `formula.cnf.samples` has one line for each produced sample. The first number represents the number of atomic mutations which were used to generate this sample. Then, the sample is displayed in a compact format, with characters '0' and '1' indicating the assignments to each of the variables in the independent support.

The option -n can be used to specify the maximum number of samples produced and the option -t can be used to specify the maximum time allowed for sampling.

To check the validity of the samples generated, run z3 with the option sat.quicksampler_check=true

```
z3 sat.quicksampler_check=true sat.quicksampler_check.timeout=3600.0 formula.cnf
```

The option sat.quicksampler_check.timeout can be used to establish a timeout for the checking of all samples produced. If the time required to check all samples is larger than this timeout, we will uniformly choose a subset of the samples to check. A timeout of 0.0 disables the timeout.

Running z3 with the option sat.quicksampler_check=true will read samples from `formula.cnf.samples`, check if they satisfy the formula `formula.cnf` and create a file `formula.cnf.samples.valid` with the valid samples. This final output file `formula.cnf.samples.valid` will have one line for each unique valid solution, displaying the solution in DIMACS format, followed by number of times this solution was sampled.

# Benchmarks

The benchmarks used are included under the `Benchmarks` directory. Like UniGen2, QuickSampler expects formulas in DIMACS CNF format, with the independent support specified.

# Comparison with SearchTreeSampler

For convenience, we provide the patch `STS/STS.patch` that we applied over the SearchTreeSampler source code `STS/STS.zip` for it to use the independent support for sampling.

# Comparison with UniGen2

For comparison with UniGen2, the source code can be obtained from `https://bitbucket.org/kuldeepmeel/unigen`.
